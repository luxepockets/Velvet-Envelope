# Foil Stamping vs. Debossing: Which One Is Right?

## Foil Stamping  
Foil stamping applies metallic foil with heat and pressure for a high-shine, luxurious finish.

**Pros**:  
- Metallic contrast  
- Sharp finish  
- Ideal for velvet  

## Debossing  
Debossing presses a design into the material for a subtle, tactile impression.

**Pros**:  
- Elegant, understated  
- No foil cracking  
- Works great on soft paper  

## Choose Based on Project

| Project Type | Suggested Finish      |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Bold invites | Foil stamping          |
| Minimal cards| Blind debossing        |
| Mixed stock  | Use both as contrast   |
